# CodeAlpha_Secure_File_Transfer
This project is a secure file transfer application built with Python, designed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transferred files. It employs end-to-end encryption, access controls, and audit logging to provide a robust solution for securely transferring sensitive data.
Key Features:
End-to-End Encryption: Files are encrypted on the client-side before transmission and decrypted only by the intended recipient.
Access Controls: User authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure that users can only access files they are authorized to.
Audit Logging: Comprehensive audit logs record all significant events and actions within the application, providing accountability and traceability.
Technologies Used:
Python: Used for server-side and client-side scripting.
PyCryptodome: Library utilized for encryption.
GitHub: Version control and project management.
